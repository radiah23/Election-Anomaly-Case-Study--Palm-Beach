Co-authored this case study with Catherine Weeks and Mercer Mercer. 

In this case study, we aim to answer three questions using EDA and a simple linear regression model:

-   Is there a significant relationship between Bush and Buchanan votes within Palm Beach County?
-   How does the relationship between Bush and Buchanan votes differ across other Florida counties?
-   How many miscast votes were there for Buchanan in Palm Beach County?
